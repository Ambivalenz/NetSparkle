This is intended to be used in conjunction with a Configuration subclass in order to retrieve and store info on the latest version of the app that was used, whether the app has run 1x or not, etc.&nbsp; These fields may or may not be required based on the specific Configuration that you use. At the very least, make sure your IAssemblyAccessor can grab valid info for the title of the application, the product name (which may or may not be the same as the title), and the version of the application (e.g. 3.1.2.0).</div></div>"});
